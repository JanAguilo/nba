# Databases - NBA Database Design and Implementation

This repository contains the deliverables for **Challenge 1** of the Databases course. The project focuses on designing and implementing a database to manage the operations of the **NBA** effectively.

## Overview
The project involves:
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Understanding the scenario and defining assumptions.
2. **Conceptual Model**:
   - Creating an Entity-Relation (E-R) diagram to represent the database design.
3. **Relational Model**:
   - Translating the conceptual model into a relational schema.
4. **SQL Implementation**:
   - Writing SQL scripts to deploy the database, ensuring proper table structures, primary/foreign keys, and data integrity.
